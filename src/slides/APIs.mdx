  Modern web APIs were officially born with&nbsp;

  “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-Based Software
  Architectures,” in 2000.

      It defined Representational State Transfer (REST) as a scalable
      and discoverable architecture for services exposed through HTTP.

<Notes>
  The first web APIs were meant to be consumed from server-side
  applications. New standards like CORS, WebSocket, and PostMessage
  paired with OAuth2 and JSON Web Token for authorization and
  stateless  authentication, suddenly made any modern web API 
  reachable from any JavaScript client running in a browser. All of
  the web has become something like a giant operating system. We’re
  now seeing APIs exposed for anything from payments or subscriptions
  over advanced machine learning models running in massive cloud
  environments, to services that directly affect the physical world
  like shipping or ride-sharing services, and just about anything else
  you can imagine.
